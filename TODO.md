## Core ESLint configuration

1. Update the naming convention rules. They doesn't seem to work properly for all cases that we have.
2. Review the usage of different types in template string literal, especiall numbers. Test it with big int and decided if it is reaaly such big of a problem.
3. Review the requirements to provide JSDoc for everything. Most likely, it is redundant and we can go arond without doing so, especially for interal code and APIs.

## React ESLint configuration

1. Initialize ESlint configuration for React projects.
2. Gather all of the existing ESLint configurations for React that I have at hand and add them to the rules set.
3. Review the rules that I added and filter the ones that I want to see from the ones that I don't.
4. Do more research on the existing ESLint rules for React and what of them are useful for us.
